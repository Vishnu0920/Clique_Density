        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>This report discusses the key ideas and findings from the paper <strong>"Efficient Algorithms for Densest Subgraph Discovery"</strong> by Yixiang Fang and collaborators. The paper addresses the Densest Subgraph Discovery (DSD) problem, aiming to extract subgraphs with maximum density based on edge count or clique structures.</p>
        <p>DSD appears across domains like social network analysis, biological systems, and database indexing. Traditional methods struggle with computational efficiency on large graphs.</p>
        <p>To address this, the paper proposes innovative techniques using core decomposition, which significantly reduce search space and improve runtime performance. These algorithms demonstrate substantial speedups over previous methods.</p>

        <h2>2. Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>Given a graph <strong>G(V, E)</strong> where:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>V</strong> = Set of vertices</li>
            <li><strong>E</strong> = Set of edges</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The objective is to find a subgraph D ⊆ G that maximizes edge density using efficient flow-based algorithms.</p>

        <p>We implemented and compared two approaches:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Exact Algorithm</strong> using binary search and flow networks.</li>
            <li><strong>CoreExact Algorithm</strong> using (k,Ψ)-core decomposition for optimization.</li>
